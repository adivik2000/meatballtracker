A bot to check if Boot and Shoe Service in Oakland has meatballs on the menu for a given day.

"@mroth: "I'll write a service to parse "meatballs" out of this and alert us when its on the menu"

What, you thought I was joking?

What this needs to do...
1. Hit bootandshoe website, find download link, compare to previous download?
2. follow and download link to pdf (redirection complexity?)
3. pdftotext
4. grep text for meatballs
5. tweet notification if present
